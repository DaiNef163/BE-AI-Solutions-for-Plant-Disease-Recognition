## üíª How to Run

Follow these steps to set up and run the backend server:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository and Navigate
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DaiNef163/BE-AI-Solutions-for-Plant-DiseaseRecognition.git
cd BE-AI-Solutions-for-Plant-DiseaseRecognition
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following configurations:
```plaintext
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB Atlas Connection String>
JWT_SECRET=<Your JWT Secret Key>
ZALOPAY_KEY=<Your ZaloPay API Key>
CLOUDINARY_NAME=<Your Cloudinary Cloud Name>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<Your Cloudinary API Key>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<Your Cloudinary API Secret>
NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN=<Your ngrok Auth Token> # Optional for exposing localhost
```
> üåü **MongoDB Atlas**: Use the connection string provided by MongoDB Atlas, replacing `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<cluster>` as required.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Cloudinary
Update your `cloudinary.js` (or equivalent file) with the following code:
```javascript
const cloudinary = require('cloudinary').v2;

cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_NAME,
  api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
});

module.exports = cloudinary;
```
For more details, visit [Cloudinary Documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation).

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Development Server
Start the server using:
```bash
npm start
```
The server will be available at:
- **Localhost**: `http://localhost:8080`
- **Public URL (via ngrok)**:
   - Start ngrok:
     ```bash
     ngrok http 8080
     ```
   - Copy the public URL provided by ngrok (e.g., `https://xyz.ngrok.io`) and use it for external testing.
